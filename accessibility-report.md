# CMS Accessibility Report

## Question 1
**Principle 1: Equitable Use**
* The chat system can implement a multilangual feature for people who speak different languages
to be able to use it.
* The system can implement speech-to-text features or features for those with disabilities 
like dyslexia to be able to read messages.
***
**Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**
* A future feature can be to adjust text size as well as implement dark mode for more equitable use.
* A future feature that can be implemented is to have the system run on different devices like phones
or ipads, or other devices.
***
**Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**
* The chat messaging system has clear instructions and not too much text on the screen.
* The chatroom provides errors to help users to know why the program may not work.
***
**Principle 4: Perceptible Information**
* A feature that can be implemented is sounds being made when buttons are clicked or when there's
system errors, providing audio cues.
* Another possible new feature is audio options for those who cannot read or high-contrast modes
for better perception.
***
**Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**
* The system should have an undo button that allows users to go back to the last screen they were
on if they clicked a button on accident.
* The program can implement a confirmation button before actions such as deleting or editing
messages to confirm the change.
***
**Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**
* The system could implement a voice typing system to write messages by speaking.
* The buttons are big and clear for users to easily click on and change screens.
***
**Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**
* This principle doesn't really apply to the chatroom system as it's an online program and doesn't
really have a specific size and space.
* At most, the layout is spaced it well enough for all users to be able to access them easily.
