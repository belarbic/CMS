# CMS Accessibility Report

## Question 1
**Principle 1: Equitable Use**
* The chat system can implement a multilangual feature for people who speak different languages
to be able to use it.
* The system can implement speech-to-text features or features for those with disabilities 
like dyslexia to be able to read messages.
***
**Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**
* A future feature can be to adjust text size as well as implement dark mode for more equitable use.
* A future feature that can be implemented is to have the system run on different devices like phones
or ipads, or other devices.
***
**Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**
* The chat messaging system has clear instructions and not too much text on the screen.
* The chatroom provides errors to help users to know why the program may not work.
***
**Principle 4: Perceptible Information**
* A feature that can be implemented is sounds being made when buttons are clicked or when there's
system errors, providing audio cues.
* Another possible new feature is audio options for those who cannot read or high-contrast modes
for better perception.
***
**Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**
* The system should have an undo button that allows users to go back to the last screen they were
on if they clicked a button on accident.
* The program can implement a confirmation button before actions such as deleting or editing
messages to confirm the change.
***
**Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**
* The system could implement a voice typing system to write messages by speaking.
* The buttons are big and clear for users to easily click on and change screens.
***
**Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**
* This principle doesn't really apply to the chatroom system as it's an online program and doesn't
really have a specific size and space.
* At most, the layout is spaced it well enough for all users to be able to access them easily.

## Question 2
Our chat messaging system would be marketed towards communities and organizations that need efficient,
real-time communication, such as small businesses, professional teams, social groups and friends. It is particularly 
suited for those seeking a user-friendly platform with essential features like message editing and deletion,
providing flexibility and accessibility for users of all technical skill levels. Additionally, the program's
customizable design makes it appealing for developers or businesses looking to integrate communication features
into their existing platforms. Its focus on simplicity and functionality ensures it meets the needs of both
formal and casual communication settings, making it versatile for all audiences.

## Question 3
If we don't take into account the diversity of our users when designing the Chat Messaging System (CMS), our project
can be less accessible to some groups. Older users may find it difficult to navigate complicated interfaces or small
text sizes, for instance, while users with disabilities, such those who have visual impairments, may encounter
difficulties if the system does not support screen readers or has no visual settings that can be adjusted.
As the embedded ethics modules emphasize, neglecting to account for user variety runs the potential of producing both
relational and practical disadvantages, such as limiting communication access and making users feel inferior to others.
We could use universal design principles to enhance CMS in order to address these possible drawbacks. Features like high
contrast modes, text size adjustments, and compatibility with assistive technology like screen readers,
for example, would be in line with the ideas of equitable use and visible information. Furthermore, addressing the
difficulties encountered by older users or those who are not tech-savvy would involve streamlining the interface and
providing easy-to-use navigation. By combining these qualities, we can make CMS more accessible to a wider range of
users and less likely to cause harm.
